  abstract={Wind energy is an effective supplement to traditional energy sources. However, wind power generation is strongly weather-dependent and thus not only unsustainable in terms of production, but also highly volatile. This complex variability poses a huge challenge to the smooth operation of the grid system. In this scenario, a unique Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset from Longyuan Power Group Corp. Ltd (SDWPF) is used for modern wind turbine power forecasting. In this work, we propose a framework for accurate wind power generation forecasting (WPF) based on deep learning. To obtain a more generalizable learner, we use ensemble learning to build our framework, which consists of the following two parts: a) a modified version of the DLinear model, which uses time series decomposition and linear layers for information aggregation, and b) an extreme time-gated network that adaptively captures finegrained information and re-aggregates information by spatial location in the inference stage to obtain higher forecasting accuracy. The results indicate that our proposed combined model framework can capture long-term time series information well. Our code is available at https://github. com/shaido987/KDD_wind_power_forecast.},
