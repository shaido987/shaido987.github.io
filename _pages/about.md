Hi, I'm Marcus. Born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden, now living in Hong Kong. I'm a Senior Engineer at Noah's Ark Lab with a focus on research.

Previously, I obtained my master's degree at [Chalmers](https://www.chalmers.se/en/) in Computer Science with a specialization in algorithms, logic, and languages. During this time, I spent one year as an exchange student in Taiwan at the [NCTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Chiao_Tung_University) and one year in Hong Kong at [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) for full-time Chinese (Mandarin) studies. Before this, I also obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science at Chalmers.

My research has been guided by the different business projects I've worked on, covering a range of topics, but always focused on machine learning and AI. I have done a lot of work with time series (forecasting, anomaly detection, spatio-temporal graphs) and various anomaly detection scenarios with e.g. out-of-distribution data, label noise, and active learning. These days, I'm within the Embodied AI team and engaged in research in robotics, VLMs/VLAs, and reinforcement learning.
