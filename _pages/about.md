Hi, I'm Marcus. Born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden, now living in Hong Kong. I'm a Senior Engineer at Noah's Ark Lab with a focus on research.

Previously, I obtained my master's degree at [Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalmers_University_of_Technology) in Computer Science with a specialization in algorithms, logic, and languages. During this time, I spent one year as an exchange student in Taiwan at the [NCTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Chiao_Tung_University) and one year in Hong Kong at [CUHK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_University_of_Hong_Kong) for full-time Chinese (Mandarin) studies. Before this, I also obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science at Chalmers.

My research has been guided by the various business projects I've worked on, leading to a wide range of topics. In the field of research, I'm therefore more of a generalist, with all the advantages that brings. These days, I'm within the embodied AI team and thus work with robotics, VLMs/VLAs, and reinforcement learning.
