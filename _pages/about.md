Hi, I'm Marcus. Originally from Gothenburg, Sweden, I now call Hong Kong home. I currently serve as a Senior Research Engineer at Noah's Ark Lab, where my work centers on cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

I hold a master’s degree in Computer Science from [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/), with a specialization in algorithms, logic, and languages. During my studies, I broadened my horizons through international experiences, including a year as an exchange student at National Chiao Tung University ([NCTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Chiao_Tung_University)) in Taiwan and another year at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html)), where I pursued full-time studies in Chinese (Mandarin). Prior to my master’s, I also earned a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Chalmers.

My research is driven by real-world business challenges and spans a diverse range of topics, all unified by a focus on machine learning and AI. I have extensive experience working with time series data, including forecasting, anomaly detection, and spatio-temporal graphs. Additionally, I have explored various anomaly detection scenarios, tackling challenges such as out-of-distribution data, label noise, and active learning. Currently, as part of the Embodied AI team, my research focuses on robotics, vision-language models (VLMs/VLAs), and reinforcement learning.
