## Challenge details

The [competition](https://baidukddcup2022.github.io/)'s goal was to estimate the wind power supply of a wind farm at different time scales. The variability of wind power presents substantial challenges in incorporating it into an energy grid system. Wind power forecasting has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation.

Two interesting features are different from standard wind power forecasting scenarios:

- Spatial distribution: the relative location of all wind turbines is given to model the spatial correlation among wind turbines.
- Dynamic context: important weather situations and turbine internal contexts monitored by each wind turbine are provided.

The dataset includes:

### Proposed solution

The solution we ended up proposing is detailed here {% cite kalander2022wind %} with a short presentation available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fPL44g5h-c). In short, it's a fusion of two different models:

- Modified DLinear (MDLinear): An altered version of DLinear {% cite  Zeng2022AreTE --file references %}.
- Extreme Temporal Gated Network (XTGN): based on stacking gated temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) {% cite  dauphin2017 lea2016tcn --file references %} and nearest neighbor information diffusion.

Both models use a masked loss function that ignores missing, unknown, or abnormal values.

From the SHAP values illustrated above, we can determine that not all features are important.

- We directly remove the directional features _Wdir_ and _Ndir_ (wind direction and nacelle yaw).
- We also remove all the temperature-related features: _Etmp_ and _Itmp_ (temperatures for the environment and inside the turbine).

Moreover, looking at the feature correlation heatmap, we can immediatly see that the pitch angles (_Pab1_, _Pab2_, _Pab3_) are perfectly correlated. We merge these to

$$
Pab_{max}=max(Pab1, Pab2, Pab3).
$$

This gives us a final feature set of five features: turbine ID, wind speed, maximum pitch angle, reactive power, and active power (also the target variable).

### MDLinear: Modified DLinear

The method is based on DLinear {% cite  Zeng2022AreTE --file references %} which is a simple but effective method that has been shown to outperform numerous transformer-based models on multiple time series forecasting tasks. By design, the method operates on univariate time series data. For multivariate time series, the forecasts of each feature are thus independent of the others. The method first decomposes the time series into trend and residual components. Two one-layer linear networks ($$ W_t $$ and $$ W_r $$) are then applied to the respective component before the two results are merged into a final forecast output.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/kdd_cup_wind/mdlinear.png" title="Overview of the MDLinear method." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
	<div class="caption">
		Overview of the MDLinear method.
	</div>
    </div>
</div>

We modify DLinear to exploit all available information by adding an additional linear layer at the end to consolidate the information from all input features and denote our method MDLinear. The complete method design is illustrated in the above figure.

<div class="profile float-right">
	{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/kdd_cup_wind/clusters_with_id2.png" title="Wind turbine cluster and ID assignments" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
	<div class="caption">
		Wind turbine cluster and ID assignments.
	</div>
</div>

We apply some additional feature engineering steps for MDLinear. The _TurbID_ is split into two separate features: _cluster_ and _ID_ by adhering to the wind turbines‚Äô x-coordinates, while the ùêºùê∑ is assigned
based on the y-coordinates. A new feature is added, _cluster\_avg_, with the average _Patv_ of each cluster. For cluster ùëê with a set of wind turbines $$ C $$, we have

$$
cluster\_avg_{c} = \frac{1}{n_c} \sum_{i=1}^{n_c} Patv^{C(i)},
$$

where $$ n_c $$ is the number of wind turbines in cluster $$ c $$ and $$ Patv^{C(i)} $$ the wind power of the ùëñ-th wind turbine in $$ C $$. Note that _cluster\_avg_has the same value for all wind turbines within the same cluster at the same timestep.

	<div class="caption">
		MDLinear train and forecast strategy.
	</div>
</div>

Training a single model to make future forecasts is not always advantageous. Shortterm and long-term patterns can vastly differ and a model that focuses on the full horizon may fail to capture important short-term patterns. Therefore, in MDLinear, we train four separate models with increasing forecast horizons [72, 188, 216, 288] and merge these to create a final prediction. The last predicted 72 timesteps of each model are used. The figure to the right illustrates the procedure.
