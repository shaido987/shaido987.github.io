I co-maintain the [trustworthyAI](https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI) repository for the Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, including [gCastle](https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI/tree/master/gcastle) {% cite zhang2021gcastle %}, a causal structure learning toolchain.

gCastle contains various functionalities related to causal learning and evaluation, including:

- Data generation and processing: data simulation, data reading operators, and data pre-processing operatorsï¼ˆsuch as prior injection and variable selection).
- Causal structure learning: causal structure learning methods, including classic and recently developed methods, especially gradient-based ones that can handle large problems.
- Evaluation metrics: various commonly used metrics for causal structure learning, including F1, SHD, FDR, TPR, FDR, NNZ, etc.
