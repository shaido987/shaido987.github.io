I co-maintain the [TrustworthyAI](https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI) repository at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab, with a focus on [gCastle](https://github.com/huawei-noah/trustworthyAI/tree/master/gcastle) {% cite zhang2021gcastle %}, a comprehensive toolchain for causal structure learning.

gCastle offers a wide range of functionalities for causal learning and evaluation, including:

- **Data Generation and Processing:** Tools for data simulation, data reading, and pre-processing, including operators for prior injection and variable selection.
- **Causal Structure Learning:** A collection of algorithms for causal structure learning, encompassing both classic approaches and state-of-the-art gradient-based techniques, designed to scale effectively to large-scale problems.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** A suite of widely adopted metrics for assessing causal structure learning performance, such as F1, SHD, FDR, TPR, and NNZ.
